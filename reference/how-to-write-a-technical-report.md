## Abstract
>*A short summary of what this document is about and key takeaways.*

This document is a primer on how to write a Technical Report.
Technical Reports are an important part of [the project lifecycle](). 
Following the creation of a [Project Definition Document](), work was done and things were learned whether or not the project can be deemed a "success." 
It is important to document what was done, why, and what was learned, in order to share this knowledge with others.

## Introduction
> *Tie in background information to bring readers up to speed.*

So you thought of a project, wrote a Project Definition Document, spent a lot of time and a little money, put in a ton of effort, and in the end you had a result!
Whether your project was an experiment, a piece of hardware, or is an ongoing series of projects, there are certain end points where it is important to remember what you did, how, and what happened in the end before you move on to the next thing. 
This body of knowledge should be recorded in a Technical Report.

A Technical Report does not have a standard format like a PDD, although there are key elements that should be in every Technical Report.
This document, like the PDD template, takes the form of a TR and serves as a functional example.

## Objectives
> *Why did you do this? What were the goals? Objectives should be traced back to the corresponding PDD.*

The point of a TR is to summarize and assess the work done for a project.
Where a PDD is a white paper, a TR is more of a research article in an academic journal or conference proceedings.

The primary objective is to communicate the form, function, and rationale behind the project results.
Not only should you capture what was done, but also why. 
These are the things we tend to forget when revisiting a project months or years later!

A secondary objective of a Technical Report is to assess and discuss the results and critique design decisions that were made.
Research is a lot of thinking and hard work, piled upon mountains of mistakes.
What lessons were learned along the way?
What happened that was unexpected, and what could have been done differently?
These questions are just as important to answer.

Another secondary objective is to prepare the documentation and materials for the possibility of publishing research later.
Technical writing is a skill that needs to be practiced, and getting in the habit will save you from a lot of headaches later on.

## Deliverables
> *What did you do or make? Describe any designs, including hardware, software, and procedures. Record what you did and why you chose to do it that way. This will likely be the largest section of the document.*

A functional example is an excellent way to show what is expected in a technical document, while also providing a baseline for style and structure.
A user may choose to emulate this writing style or gut it and start fresh, only referring to this as a reference.
Functional examples outline key elements, and including them in the template may remind writers to include them when otherwise it may be forgotten.

## Testing & Calibration
> *Did you test your hardware/software before doing your experiment? Were things calibrated? How did you establish a baseline?*

Calibrations are essential to trace back measurements to a known level of uncertainty.
The output of any measurement device is inherently erroneous, that much is certain.
Real value comes from knowing how much error is present in the measurement, and, if possible, how to correct for these errors.

## Experiment
> *Describe the experiment itself.*

(Functional examples can only do so much, give me a break!)

## Results
> *Summarize the results. Include measurements, qualitative observations, unusual events, and other important data.*

(What happened?)

## Discussion
> *Discuss the results. Were they what was expected? Did it completely fail? Somewhere in between? Most important of all: WHY?*

Do not omit significant errors and failures!
When things go wrong and things fail, this is not a bad thing.
We must understand what went wrong and why--and document it!--in order to be successful on the next attempt.

## Future Work
> *What might a follow-on project look like?*

WUAP2?
