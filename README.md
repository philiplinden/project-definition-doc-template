# Project Definition Document Template

This is an opinionated, batteries-included template for project proposals with
formatting boilerplate. It is a successor to
[rit-spec/SPEX-Project-Definition-Documents](https://github.com/rit-spex/SPEX-Project-Definition-Documents).

See the [examples](examples/) created from this template. There is also some
[reference material](reference/) included here, like the original IEEE template
and some example bibliography files with a variety of citation types.

## What is a Project Definition Document?

The intent of a Project Definition Document (PDD) is to organize and document a
project idea and its objectives. In the ideal project life cycle, an idea
undergoes an initial research phase where an individual or a small team
develops the primary objectives and requirements. The PDD is a snapshot of the
known challenges, risks, and anticipated areas for research at the very start
of a project.

### Are all the sections in the template required?

Short answer: No.

Long answer: **The template was written as a functional example. Read it!** One
reason to write a PDD is to guide you to focus and refine your project concept.
Writing this document will hopefully guide you to think about how your project
will grow in the future and and what major obstacles will be in your way. While
many sections of the template are specific to the template as a PDD itself, I
expect many of the same discussions to appear in your project as well.

### Why use LaTeX instead of a regular word processor?

LaTeX is not a word processor. It allows you to write content without worrying
about formatting or typesetting -- LaTeX handles all the organization,
placement of text, spacing, headings, and so on. It is the de facto standard
for technical and scientific documents, and it is beneficial for you to be at
least somewhat familiar with using it, especially if you plan to do research in
the future. For more about LaTeX, [visit their

## Using the template for your own PDDs

If you find a bug or encounter a persistent issue with the template, please
create a new [issue](https://github.com/philiplinden/project-definition-doc-template/issues)
describing your problem so it can be fixed.

### Fork the template

This is a _template_ repository. It is meant to be forked and live a new life
outside of this repo.

According to the [official Github
docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template),
Creating a repository from a template is similar to forking a repository, but there are important differences:

- A new fork includes the entire commit history of the parent repository, while a repository created from a template starts with a single commit.
- Commits to a fork don't appear in your contributions graph, while commits to a repository created from a template do appear in your contribution graph.
- A fork can be a temporary way to contribute code to an existing project, while creating a repository from a template starts a new project quickly.

### Get writing

1. **READ.** Read a lot of technical writing, good AND bad. This will help you
   refine your skill while giving you goal posts to shoot for and pitfalls to
   avoid.

2. **WRITE.** You don't get better without practice. Personal projects are a
   good safe place to do this because nobody sees the writing unless you share
   it. If you think it's good, its an amazing feeling to share a well
   documented project--it makes the project itself look that much better.

3. **DON'T OVERTHINK IT.** With technical writing, the goal is to convey your
   ideas as completely yet as concisely as possible. Sometimes sharing too much
   detail can obstruct the main idea you're trying to convey. Likewise, not
   enough detail and the main idea gets lost or misunderstood. It's a balance
   that you'll discover with tips 1 and 2.

4. **DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.** Even if your words are written well, they can
   still be confusing. If someone reads your words and is confused, there is
   probably a good reason for that. Take mental notes of the way you explain it
   to them verbally and see if you can work that in to the original confusing
   bit. Every time you explain what you meant to say, that means there is an
   opportunity to improve what you wrote. Iteration is necessary 99.9% of the
   time. Don't let it get to you and keep writing. But don't let it get to your
   head--you can _always_ write something better.

5. **FORMATTING COMES FIRST AND LAST.** This one is tricky. What I mean is that
   when you block out your ideas just starting out a piece of writing, organize
   it in a way that makes the most sense for your mental model of what you
   intend to write. Build the scaffolding. For me, this includes lots of
   subheadings or bulleted lists. The framework usually lingers as comments.
   When writing the meat of it, don't get hung up on formatting. At that point
   your goal is to get the words out and into your scaffold. Finally, take some
   time to format things well. How words are arranged can have a significant
   impact on how they are received or understood. In short: Put up the frame,
   lay the pipes, electrical, and lights. Then put up the drywall and buy your
   furniture. Then paint the walls and rearrange the furniture. Then keep
   repainting and rearranging for the next 20 years.

### Do the project

You don't need to be ready, you just need to go.

A technical report on what happened when you did the project is a great way to
capture the process and lessons learned along the way. Explain the end result
but also take the time to reflect and see how you can improve for next time.

See [How to write a technical report](reference/how-to-write-a-technical-report.md).
